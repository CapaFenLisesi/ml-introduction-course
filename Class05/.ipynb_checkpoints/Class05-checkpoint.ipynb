    "One of the skills in working with data is to pull multiple data sets together. There are often features we would like to use in training our machine learning model that aren't necessarily in the dataset we have in front of us. For example, we may be looking at attendance figures at baseball games, trying to predict what they will be for future games. However, we only have team statistics. The attendance certainly depends on the weather at the stadium (or in the city) on the day of a game. So we would like to be able to gather the weather data and add it to our model. We'll go through how to do something like that."
