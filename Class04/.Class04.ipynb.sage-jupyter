We start with a sample dataset from Sebastian Thrun's Udacity Machine Learning course. Here's the scenario: we are building a self-driving car. We have mapped out the course we are taking and created a dataset that indicates, on a scale from 0 to 1, how bumpy the road is and, on the same scale, how steep the road is (measured in \"grade\"). For each road we need to know whether we should have the car drive \"slow\" or \"fast\". For example, we want to slow down for bumpy roads. But we may want to speed up when we are going up steep hills. I've created a sample dataset from fake data that maps this out. We start by loading and plotting the data."}

{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Evaluation Metrics\n\nFirst, we review the evaluation metric we've already seen: the RMS value for the linear regression. Recall from Class 02 that we calculated this by taking our model prediction, subtracting the actual value, squaring the difference, then averaging over all points in the test set. Finally, we took the square root of this to get the RMS: \"[Square]Root [of the] Mean-Squared\". A perfect fit would give an RMS of 0.0 and larger RMS values mean that the fit is not performing as well.\n\nThere are more ways to evaluate the performance of a classifier model. They all start with the confusion matrix, so we'll start there.\n\n### The Confusion Matrix\n\nThe first thing we do is recognize that there are, for a binary, or two-state classifier, four possible outcomes when we evaluate each test point:\n1. The prediction says \"slow\" and the actual label says \"slow\"\n2. The prediction says \"fast\", but the actual label says \"slow\"\n3. The prediction says \"slow\", but the actual label says \"fast\"\n1. The prediction says \"fast\" and the actual label says \"fast\"\n\n\nThe first and last possibilies indicate that the prediction did a good job, but the other two mean there were problems. Let's make this into a table:\n\n\n|           | | Predicted | Predicted|\n|:--------: |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|  | |  Slow | Fast | \n|**Actual**\t|Slow | #1  | #2 |\n|**Actual**\t| Fast | #3 | #4 | | \n\nNow we need to count how many of each possibility there were using the test data.

Unfortunately, there is no unique way of doing that. There are a couple of different metrics that people use and we can quickly go through them. There is a nice summary [here](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/12/best-metric-measure-accuracy-classification-models.html) of some of the metrics and how people use them.\n\n#### Class-dependent Metrics\n\nThe first three metrics depend on what your target is. For example, with the Sensitivity/Recall score, the goal is to either correctly predict when to go slow or to correctly predict when to go fast. So there are two outputs from the score, depending on which is more important to you. Of course you could average them if you want and get something in the middle.\n\n#### Class-independent Metrics\n\nThe last two metrics take all the possibilities into account and wrap them up as a single number. Which metric you use is something of a personal preference. However, it is good practice to use the same metric when comparing different models."}

If you are interested in *how* the classifier works, I suggest either [this tutorial](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/CE/Bayesian%20Classification%20withInsect_examples.pdf) or reading the [Wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier).

A straight-line is the simplest possible decision boundary and, therefore, is valued highly from the perspective of keeping the model as simple as possible. A smooth curve is slightly more complicated, but still fairly simple. The question is: do we gain out-of-sample performance by adding in the complexity of making the decision boundary curve? \n\nThat brings us to the second point: the confusion matrix now shows us that we have mis-classified 17 points.
